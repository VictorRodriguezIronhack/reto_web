### The Challenge

#### Write a simple REST API.
 - Have 1 endpoint `/phone`
 - Return the attached "phones.json" charge
 - There is no need for a persistence layer (BBDD). 

#### Write a React application that displays the API phones.
 - Use Axios to get REST API data.
 - Display an initial list of all phones.
 - When a phone model is selected from the list, a detailed view of the phone is displayed showing some more details about it.
 - Show a spinner or placeholder type component while the API request is in progress.
 - Make it look decent. There's no need for a super sophisticated design, but at least make it a bit sensitive so that it doesn't look terrible on a cell phone. Add images for each device.

#### Send the code to a public github repository with a README.md that explains how to run the API and the Frontend application.
