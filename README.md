Phone Cave is a Single Page Application whose mission is to offer the best phones at the best market price. You can check their details and perfom four different actions: **Create**, **Read**, **Update** and **Delete** (CRUD).

**Website:** [Live Demo](https://phone-cave.herokuapp.com/)

## Goal :heavy_check_mark:

**1. Write a simple phone REST API in the language you find most convenient (NodeJS, Rails, Java) that...**
 - Have 1 endpoint `/phones`
 - Return the attached "phones.json" charge
 - There is no need for a persistence layer (BBDD). 
 
**2. Write a React application that displays the API phones.**
 - Use Redux for state management and Axios (or a similar library) to get data from the REST API. (You may not use Redux)
 - Display an initial list of all phones
 - When you select a phone model from the list, a detailed view of the phone is displayed showing some more details about the phone.
 - Show a spinner or placeholder type component while the API request is in progress.
 - Make it look decent. There's no need for a super sophisticated design, but at the very least, make it a bit sensitive so that it doesn't look terrible on a mobile phone. Add images for each device.
 
**3. Send the code to a public github repository with a README.md that explains how to run the API and the Frontend application.**

## Get Started :rocket:

**CLIENT**
- Run `npm i` on the root directory
- Create a `.env` file on the root directory to include the API URL (`REACT_APP_API_URL`)
- Run `npm start` command on the root directory


**SERVER**
- Run `npm i` on the root directory
- Create a `.env` file on the root directory to populate the database (`DB`), include the port (`PORT`), domain (`DOMAIN`) and Cloudinary credentials (`NAME, KEY, SECRET`).
- Run `npm run dev` command on the root directory
