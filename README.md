##### The Challenge

###### Write a simple API REST (in NodeJS, Rails or Java) 

 - It must have one endpoint `/telefonos`
 - Return the information of the "phones.json"
 - There is no need to have a persistant layer (DB). 
 
###### Display the API Phones in a SPA using React

 - Get the data of the API REST using Axios
 - Display a list of all the phones
 - Display a list of details of the phone model when it is selected.
 - There must be a spinner while the API request is in progress.
 - It should look decent. There is no need to create a super sofisticated design, but at least it shouldn't look terrible on a mobile device. Add images for each phone model.
 
 ###### Send the code to a public GitHub repository with a README.md that includes how to run the API and the Frontend Application.
 
##### Setup

Firstly,`fork` and `clone` this repository.

 ###### Server
